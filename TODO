### Summary for JSON Validation with Language Models

**Objective:** Ensure JSON data received from language model function calls matches the expected schema and provide feedback for corrections.

**Workflow:**

1. **Define Expected Data Schema:**
   - Use Pydantic models to specify the structure and constraints of the expected JSON data.

2. **Receive Data:**
   - Obtain JSON responses from the language model after function calls.

3. **Parse and Validate:**
   - Use Pydantic to parse and validate the received JSON against the defined schema.

4. **Handle Validation Errors:**
   - Catch validation errors, generate clear error messages, and log/display/send feedback as needed.

5. **Use Valid Data:**
   - Proceed with business logic using the validated data if it passes validation.

6. **Send Feedback for Corrections:**
   - If validation fails, send a message back to the language model, explaining the errors and requesting a corrected response.

**Benefits:**

- **Data Integrity:** Ensures that only valid data is processed.
- **Clear Feedback:** Provides detailed error messages for easier correction.
- **Automation:** Streamlines the validation process, reducing manual checks.
- **Interoperability:** Facilitates smooth integration with different language models by adhering to strict schemas.
